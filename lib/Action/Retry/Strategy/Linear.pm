=head1 NAME

Action::Retry::Strategy::Linear - Linear incrementation of sleep time strategy

=head1 VERSION

version 0.17

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To be used as strategy in L<Action::Retry>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 initial_sleep_time

  ro, Int, defaults to 1000 ( 1 second )

The number of milliseconds to wait for the first retry

=head2 multiplicator

  ro, Int, defaults to 2

Number multiplied by the last sleep time. E.g. if set to 2, the time between
two retries will double. If set to 1, it'll remain constant. Defaults to 2

=head2 max_retries_number

  ro, Int|Undef, defaults to 10

The number of times we should retry before giving up. If set to undef, will
retry indefinitely

=head2 max_sleep_time

  ro, Int|Undef, defaults to undef

If Action::Retry is about to sleep more than this number ( in milliseconds ),
stop retrying.
